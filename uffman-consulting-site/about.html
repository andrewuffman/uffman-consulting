            <h3>Professional journey</h3>
            <p>Andrew brings more than a decade of hands‑on financial experience, including 8 years running order‑to‑cash functions at a Fortune 11 pharmaceutical distributor.  At AmerisourceBergen, he managed 45 global finance professionals and oversaw $8B in client receivables while achieving team KPIs and leading process‑improvement initiatives.  Earlier roles include Finance Manager at a fast‑growing apartment‑locating company and accounts receivable leadership positions at logistics and energy firms.  Across these roles he gained deep expertise in billing, collections, cash application, budgeting, forecasting, and financial modeling.</p>

            <h3>Leadership &amp; collaboration</h3>
            <p>Andrew’s people‑first leadership style retains and develops talent.  He has built high‑performing teams, created career progression plans and improved onboarding programs.  Collaboration is central to his approach—whether partnering with IT to implement bots that save $80K annually, guiding cross‑functional teams through ERP integrations, or working with executives to develop annual strategic plans.  He believes effective order‑to‑cash management requires every stakeholder from finance, operations and customer service to work in harmony.</p>

            <h3>Analytical mindset</h3>
            <p>Data is the foundation for Andrew’s advice.  He has designed scorecards and dashboards to track DSO, receivables currency, and un‑invoiced orders; built custom CRM and collections systems that improved receivables currency by 26 %; and developed sophisticated financial models for M&amp;A evaluation, profitability analysis and cash‑flow forecasting.  His critical‑thinking skills allow him to uncover inefficiencies and recommend solutions that deliver measurable ROI.</p>

            <h3>Education &amp; certifications</h3>
            <p>Andrew earned his Master of Business Administration from the Satish &amp; Yasmin Gupta College of Business.  During his MBA he was an active member of Beta Gamma Sigma and served as president of Sigma Iota Epsilon.  He continues to stay current on industry best practices in accounts receivable and finance.</p>

            <h3>Community &amp; values</h3>
